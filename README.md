## 💫 About Me

**`Electronics Maker ⚡️`**

I am an Electrical & Electronics Engineer👨‍💻 by day and a Maker👨‍🏭🔩 by night. 

Since my childhood, electronics has excited me the most, which is why I love❤️ teardowns, rebuilding stuff, and watching how-to videos on the internet. 

Love to fuse my knowledge with my passion to make interesting things🦼🛠️.
